<h1>K-Means clustering</h1>
<p>This tool implements <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/cluster.vq.html">k-means clustering</a>
    from the scipy library. In particular this uses <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.vq.kmeans2.html">kmeans2</a>
    to cluster an input point dataset. The cluster labels are then added to a
    label field in the output dataset. In addition the centroids of the clusters
    are output to a new dataset, also with the label field.</p>

<h2>Input parameters</h2>

<h3>Input layer</h3>

<p>The base point dataset. The selected points within this dataset will be
    clustered and written to the output dataset along with a cluster field.</p>

<h3>K (number of clusters)</h3>

<p>The number of clusters built by the algorithm. This does not guarantee that
    this many clusters will be formed.</p>

<h3>Method for initialization</h3>

<p>The method for first guessing where the cluster centroids will be. For more
detailed explanation see the <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.vq.kmeans2.html">kmeans2</a> documentation.</p>

<h2>Output parameters</h2>

<h3>Clustered features</h3>

<p>The point dataset with the cluster IDs written to the label field. All other
fields of the feature are preserved.</p>

<h3>Cluster centroids</h3>

<p>The point dataset with the cluster centroids. The cluster centroids are tagged
with the cluster ID using the label field name.</p>

<h3>Number of clusters formed</h3>

<p>A count of the clusters formed when runnig the algorithm.</p>
