name=Scipy Point Clustering
qgisMinimumVersion=2.0
description=This plugin implements clustering for point data using the scipy module.
version=0.2
author=Henry Walshaw
email=henry.walshaw@spatialvision.com.au

about=This plugin implements point custering in scipy and add a label integer
      field to the feature class for the clustered data. Both hierarchical and
      k-means clustering are implemented.

      This is a Procesing plugin (actuvated automatically) and can be found in
      the processing toolbox.

      Please note that there are memory limitations in hierarchical clustering -
      the space required to create the clusters is O(n^2), which means that
      larger datasets will run out of memory fast. As such there is a plugin
      setting in the Processing options that sets the upper limit of points to
      process, by default set at 10,000. K-means is much more forgiving in terms
      of memory, so the limit is not enforced in those algorithms.

      All credit to the scipy team for the original implementation of the cluster
      algorithms.

changelog=0.2 (19th March 2015) Set the plugin to be automatically activated and
    note that it is a processing algorithm. Add the number of clusters formed to
    the output. Add a limit to the number of points that can be processed for
    hierarchical processing, and add the setting to the provider menu.

    0.1 (19th March 2015) Cluster algorithms created and submitted to the
        QGIS plugin repository.
